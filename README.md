# Children Contest

We're at a contest with prizes for children. 
Each prize is an `object` (toy or whatever) and children will choose their prize. 
We want to have an **application which accounts for all of the available prizes and the taken prizes**. 
The "available prizes" inventory may contain several items of the same prize, but only one child is allowed to choose a particular prize. 
Once a child has chosen a prize, the remaining children will have to chose any other prize.
   
     Please implement the necessary _features so that the inventory is always up-to-date_. 
     At the same time, we need to know which are the taken prizes (please use a `set` for this).
     Implement a feature what will allow us to display the taken prizes
